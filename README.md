# Leia backend

Phase 1 Express and TypeScript backend skeleton with Supabase migrations.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer
- npm
- A Supabase project or local Supabase development environment

## Local setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide the backend-only credentials:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is a secret and must never be exposed to a frontend, committed, or logged.

3. Apply the SQL files in `supabase/migrations` in filename order using your Supabase migration workflow.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Check the health endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   ```

   Expected response: `{"status":"ok"}`.

## Validation

```bash
npm run build
npm run typecheck
```

RLS is enabled on every Phase 1 table. No public policies are created in this phase; database access is backend-only through the service-role client.
